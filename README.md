# Google-Stock-Price-Predcition-using-LSTM-Algorithm
The project aims to predict Google's stock prices using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data. By training on historical stock data, the LSTM model learns patterns and trends, enabling it to make future price predictions. The project enhances financial analysis and decision-making by providing insights into potential stock price movements.
